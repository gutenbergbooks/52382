<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>This paper is primarily an analysis of a sample of migrant birds
killed in the autumn of 1954 by striking a television tower one mile
west of Topeka, Shawnee County, Kansas. Secondarily, some aspects
of migration involved in studies of this kind are discussed and
historical background is presented.</p>

<p>Considerable interest has been occasioned in recent years in the
eastern United States by large-scale accidents to night-migrating
birds. Most accidents have occurred in the autumn. The widespread
adoption by airports of an instrument called the ceilometer,
which measures the height of cloud ceilings by reflecting from them
a high-powered beam of light, has proved under certain conditions
to be catastrophic to night-flying birds. Among the recent reports
of such accidents are those of Spofford (1949) and Laskey (1951)
for Nashville, Tennessee, Howell and Tanner (1951) for Knoxville,
Tennessee, and Lovell (1952) for Louisville, Kentucky. Recently
Howell, Laskey, and Tanner (1954) reviewed ceilometer "tragedies"
without being able to determine the exact reason for their lethal
effectiveness. Less publicized so far have been mass collisions of
birds with another class of obstacles, tall radio and television towers.
These slender towers, usually 500 to 1000 feet tall, are increasing
rapidly in numbers and there is reason to suppose that they will
take a correspondingly larger toll of bird life.</p>

<p>Notice has long been given by ornithologists to mass destruction
of birds by more conventional solid obstructions to passage, and
newspapers occasionally mention birds killed at such well-known
points as the Washington Monument and the Empire State Building.</p>

<p>Seventy-five years ago, J. A. Allen (1880) published the results
of questionnaires circulated by William Brewster to lighthouse
keepers. Brewster himself (1886) described destruction of birds
at a lighthouse in the Bay of Fundy, paying keen attention to behavior
of the birds and the exact conditions under which nocturnal
flight and accidents occurred. The subject also received attention
in several countries across the Atlantic. Destruction of birds at
Irish lighthouses was carefully noted over a period of years and the
results were published periodically, culminating in R. M. Barrington's
massive report (1900) which remains in some ways the most
thorough of its type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>While conservation-minded individuals have been concerned with
the tremendous mortality involved in these various events, the ill
wind blows some good in that, properly used, the data provided
by such accidents can shed light on many obscure aspects of bird
migration. Each accidental kill of birds affords a cross-section,
approaching in variable degree a random sample, of the migrants
passing a given point on a given date. The types of information
provided by such kills are numerous, for example: (1) information
on the presence of various species and the dates of their occurrence;
(2) information on the relative abundance of species; (3) quantitative
data on the relative sizes of males and females, and immatures
and adults (of importance to taxonomic ornithology); (4)
information on the relative times of migration of males, females,
adults, and young; (5) information on molts and plumages; (6)
quantitative information on composition by subspecies of migrants
of the same species; (7) physiological data (fat condition, <i>etc.</i>)
pertinent to the study of migration; and probably others.</p>

<p>In spite of the great potential of this kind of material, the majority
of ornithologists with access to such data have contented
themselves with listing the species and sometimes the numbers of
birds killed. A few have gone further. James T. Tanner (unpublished)
attempted to compute the longevity of the Ovenbird
(<i>Seiurus aurocapillus</i>) by analysis of ceilometer-killed birds at
Knoxville, Tennessee (see below). Mention should be made of the
reports of Rintoul and Baxter (1914) supplemented by Ticehurst
(1916) who used rather small numbers of birds killed at Scottish
lighthouses in studies of molt. However, the only effort to utilize
the results of accidental kills on a large scale over a period of years
appears to have been that, already mentioned, of Barrington (1900)
and his co-workers in Ireland. An idea of the potentialities of the
large recent kills in the United States may be obtained when it is
recalled that in the 18 years of Barrington's work, which embodied
some 1000 reports from lighthouse keepers, Barrington obtained for
study only about 2000 specimens, many of these consisting of wings
and feet only (Barrington's paper not seen in original; see J. A.
Allen, 1901:205). More recently Dobben and Bruyns (1939) have
analyzed the age and sex classes of some birds killed at lighthouses
in Holland.</p>

<p>As far as we have learned, there is no previous thorough analysis
in the literature of large, accidentally-killed samples of birds. On
the following pages we emphasize some of the uses which can be
made of such material. We think that intensive analyses of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
events, whenever they occur, should become a regular part of
ornithological investigation and that integration of numerous studies
of such incidents will provide an unprecedented mass of information
on migration.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Accidents to Migrating Birds in early October, 1954</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">General.</span>&mdash;The few days around the end of the first week of
October, 1954, were notable for a series of accidents which occurred
to migrating birds over much of eastern United States. So
far as we know, these were all associated with an extensive belt of
bad weather (cold fronts and stationary fronts) which covered
much of the country during that period, and the accidents involved
ceilometers and solid structures alike. Accidents known to us
occurred as far south as Macon, Georgia (David W. Johnston, letter:
Nov. 1, 1954), as far north as New York City, where many
migrants were killed at the Empire State Building (<i>New York
Times</i>, Thursday, October 7, 1954, p. 1) and elsewhere, and as far
west as Smoky Hill Air Force Base at Salina, Kansas (ceilometer,
October 7, some birds received at the University of Kansas). Some
of the above, and incidents from a number of other localities, were
mentioned in varying detail in <i>Audubon Field Notes</i> (vol. 9, no.
1, pp. 6, 10, 15, 17, 18, 32, February, 1955). Still other accidents
occurred at Columbia, Missouri (Richard P. Grossenheider, verbal
communication), and Topeka, Kansas (present paper). Some probably
have escaped our notice; summaries of some of these will probably
appear in ornithological journals for some time to come. At
Robins Air Force Base near Macon, Georgia, at least 50,000 birds
were killed, of which about 2500, representing 54 species, were
picked up (Johnston, <i>loc. cit.</i>).</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Accidents at Topeka, Kansas.</span>&mdash;At Topeka, Shawnee County,
Kansas, all birds were killed by collision with the newly-erected
(1954) television transmitting tower of station WIBW-TV. This
tower is one mile west of the city.</p>

<p>The first casualties (see Table 1 for all others) were a Sora (<i>Porzana
carolina</i>) and a Yellow-bellied Flycatcher (<i>Empidonax flaviventris</i>)
found on September 7. The major accidents, however,
occurred on the nights of September 24-25, September 30-October
1, October 5-6, and October 6-7. Totals of birds picked up (probably
over 95 per cent of birds killed) are given in Table 1, in which
each date given is that of the day after the kill, <i>i. e.</i>, the date on
which the birds were collected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>All major kills occurred on cloudy and foggy nights associated
with frontal weather. Throughout the period a few birds struck
the tower even on fairly clear nights, and minor but appreciable
"falls" occurred on the nights of October 4-5, 7-8, and 22-23. A few
birds killed probably were overlooked for a time and found their
way into later samples. This is especially probable in the case of
some birds entered under date of October 23, as many of these
were somewhat desiccated. Weights clearly altered by desiccation
or mutilation were not recorded. Reports of these accidents have
been published by Carson (1954 a, b, and c).</p>

<p>According to Carson (1954c:27), the majority of birds killed on
nights of heavy flight fell "between three and four o'clock in the
morning when skies were overcast and a cool front moved in from
the north. Due to the cooperation of the watchmen it is thought
that most of the birds that were killed were recovered. Of course
some injured birds in hiding were not found and some were lost to
predators."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Description of WIBW-TV TOWER</span>.&mdash;The tower is 950 feet tall
and stands on a hill approximately 1000 feet above sea level. The
fact that the tower is on a hill places the top of the tower at 1010
feet above the elevation of the average local terrain. The tower
is triangular in cross-section, each face seven feet wide, and is
constructed of six-inch steel L-beams with three-inch cross-members
every seven feet and smaller diagonal cross-members. It has no
taper and bears a transmitting antenna on the top. The tower is
supported by 12 guy wires, 3 wires attaching at each of 4 levels.
The cables extend south, WNW, and NNE from the tower and are
1-1/2 inches in diameter. The tower is lighted by a series of red lights,
some flashing and others steady. The transmitter was not in operation
when the accidents took place.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Weather conditions.</span>&mdash;All major kills at Topeka occurred when
migrating birds encountered either a cold front or a stationary front
lying over eastern Kansas. Typically, this frontal weather included
rain, fog, and cloud ceilings down to as low as 800 to 1000 feet.
Weather of this type presumably forces the migrating birds to fly
below the cloud ceiling and thus brings them within the altitudinal
range of the television towers.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>


<p>We gratefully acknowledge our debt to the Topeka Audubon Society for
making this study possible by carefully collecting birds killed at the television
tower. L. B. Carson deserves special mention for his general supervision of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>the bird collecting by the members of the Topeka Audubon Society. Members
of the Society and others who picked up birds under the television tower were:
Mrs. Lloyd Biggs, Elaine Carson, L. B. Carson, Jesse A. Eddy, Elizabeth Fisher,
Mrs. Walter Huxman, Florence McKinney, Mrs. Charles Martin, Mrs. Fred P.
Martin, T. W. Nelson, Fred Prebble, Grace Prebble, Orville Rice, Mrs. G.
Warren Scholl, E. W. Senne, and Beatrice Swenson.</p>

<p>We received equally important assistance from students and staff of the
University of Kansas in recording of data and preparation of specimens. The
following helped in these ways: Rollin H. Baker, R. W. Dickerman, David
L. Hardy, J. W. Hardy, Jane S. Mengel, Larry D. Mosby, Richard Van Gelder,
South G. Van Hoose, and Glen E. Woolfenden. We are indebted to the Interlibrary
Loan Service of the University of Kansas Library for help in securing
certain reference works. Robert Sokal of the University of Kansas gave helpful
advice concerning statistical procedures.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Notes on the Species Killed at Topeka</h2>


<p>A list of numbers and kinds of birds killed is given in Table 1.
Discussion of data afforded by certain species for which, large
samples were available will be found below. There are additionally
certain data afforded by the sample and certain comments to
be made on various species which can be handled most conveniently
in an annotated list. In this list we have included all weight
data (still scarce for many North American birds), comments on
status in Kansas of various species, results of comparisons to determine
subspecies, and miscellaneous observations. Weights of
birds are given in grams and were taken on a triple-beam balance.
Fat condition is given in the scale proposed by McCabe (1943:556).
Weight data from birds migrating at night should be especially
useful because these migrants all have relatively empty
crops and stomachs, thus reducing variability. Not all birds were
suitable for weighing and measuring, for a variety of reasons. This
accounts for discrepancies in totals between Table 1 and the annotated
list.</p>

<p>All passerine species were aged by noting the degree of ossification
of the skull. In no case, of the more than a thousand passerines
aged by examination of the skull, did we find difficulty in determining
whether an individual was a bird of the year or an adult.
We found no specimens in which ossification of the skull was nearing
completion. In the several species in our sample with distinctive
first-winter plumages, we found complete agreement in
age as shown by plumage and by condition of the skull. We think
this is further proof, if such is needed, that this method of aging is
thoroughly reliable in early autumn for the passerine species included
in our sample and for others with similar breeding seasons.</p>

exist between totals given here and totals given in the annotated list, these
result from the fact that some specimens could not be sexed and aged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>The annotated list may be consulted for further data in connection
with the species listed in Table 1. As is indicated below, we
regard the figures of this sample as unreliable to an unknown degree
in comparing the relative abundance of one species with another.
Accumulation of such data from various localities, however,
should prove useful in another type of comparison. Samples of the
same species killed in the same way at about the same time at different
localities should be directly comparable. Eventually, this
should provide us with a means of determining relative abundance
of a species in different parts of its migratory route.</p>

<p>Approximately 200 of the most interesting specimens were preserved
as study skins and are in the University of Kansas Museum
of Natural History. An effort was made to preserve at least one of
each species, and we fell only a few short of this goal. All of the
forms rare in Kansas are represented by skins. We could see no
reason to list the preserved specimens in detail here. Species of
which no study skins were made, however, are so marked.</p>

<p>So far as we can tell, no truly western subspecies (from west of
the Great Plains) occurred in the Topeka sample. Probably most
or all of the birds came from areas more or less directly north of
eastern Kansas.</p>

<p>In critical areas where different subspecies of the same species
occur together in migration, data from samples of this kind should
prove enlightening. In future analyses, conducted in such areas,
it might be possible to preserve all specimens of some of the variable
species, or at least to measure all individuals of species in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
size is the most important variable character. Quantitative study
could then be made of the different geographic variants occurring,
their proportions in the migrant population determined, and their
origins deduced. In studying populations of Painted Buntings
(<i>Passerina ciris</i>) wintering in Mexico, Storer (1951) has provided
an interesting demonstration of methods which can be applied to
such samples.</p>

<p>A few bats killed at the tower provided a surprise. They will be
discussed separately by Richard Van Gelder.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Podilymbus p. podiceps.</i> Pied-billed Grebe.&mdash;Weights: male, 394.8 (all
weights in grams); females, 332.5, 289.7; all fat.</p>

<p><i>Butorides v. virescens.</i> Green Heron.&mdash;Weight: 1 (unsexed), 168.6.</p>

<p><i>Anas discors.</i> Blue-winged Teal.&mdash;Weights: 4 males, mean 421.2 (391.3-458.1);
3 females, 367.7, 371.6, 393.2; all fat.</p>

<p><i>Rallus limicola.</i> Virginia Rail.&mdash;Weights: 3 males, 73.7, 83.2, 90.5; 1 female,

<p><i>Porzana carolina.</i> Sora.&mdash;Weights: 4 males, mean 76.8 (68.7-89.9); 3 females,
62.6, 63.2, 63.5; moderately fat to very fat.</p>

<p><i>Fulica americana.</i> American Coot.&mdash;Weights: 2 females, 385.3, 530.0, both
fat. None preserved.</p>

<p><i>Zenaidura macroura marginella.</i> Mourning Dove.&mdash;Weights: 2 adult males,
121.8, 140.2; 3 immature males, 113.1, 126.1, 130.0; 3 adult females, 122.5,
126.9, 136.0; 2 immature females, 129.4, 132.7; moderately fat to very fat.
The presence of Mourning Doves in the sample is interesting as these birds
are not generally regarded as night migrants. Conceivably the specimens were
local birds going to roost. None preserved.</p>

<p><i>Colaptes auratus luteus.</i> Yellow-shafted Flicker.&mdash;Weights: 2 males, 126.0,
139.4, little fat. Flickers have several times been recorded as night migrants.</p>

<p><i>Empidonax flaviventris.</i> Yellow-bellied Flycatcher.&mdash;Weight: 1 immature
male, 11.9, moderately fat. This is a rare species in Kansas, the present being
the ninth preserved specimen for the State.</p>

<p><i>Troglodytes a&euml;don parkmanii.</i> House Wren.&mdash;Weights: 4 adult males,
mean 10.5 (9.8-10.9), 2 immature males, 9.0, 11.3; 1 adult female, 9.9, 1 immature
female, 7.0; no fat (im. &#9792;) to fat.</p>

<p><i>Telmatodytes palustris dissa&euml;ptus.</i> Long-billed Marsh Wren.&mdash;Weights:
1 adult male, 10.8; 1 adult female, 9.2; both moderately fat. The specimens
are moderately bright and rufescent above, being typical of the populations of
the central plains.</p>

<p><i>Cistothorus platensis stellaris.</i> Short-billed Marsh Wren.&mdash;Weights: 1 immature
male, 8.2; 1 adult female, 8.1; immature female, 8.2; all fat.</p>

<p><i>Dumetella carolinensis.</i> Catbird.&mdash;Weights: 6 adult males, mean 37.5
(34.1-42.5), little fat to very fat; 14 immature males, mean 37.57 &plusmn; .94 (standard
error), S. D. (standard deviation) 3.37, little fat to fat; 11 adult females,
mean 39.09 &plusmn; .94, S. D. 2.97, little fat to fat; 12 immature females, mean
38.42 &plusmn; .83, S. D. 2.74, moderately fat to fat.</p>

<p><i>Toxostoma r. rufum.</i> Brown Thrasher.&mdash;Weight: 1 immature male, 60.2,
little fat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Hylocichla mustelina.</i> Wood Thrush.&mdash;Weights: 1 adult male, 54.2, moderately
fat; 2 adult females, 44.6, 45.7, little fat and fat, respectively.</p>

<p><i>Hylocichla ustulata swainsonii.</i> Olive-backed Thrush.&mdash;Weights: 6 immature
males, mean 31.0 (28.1-33.2), little fat to fat; 6 adult females, mean 29.6 (27.1-35.0),
moderately fat to fat; 3 immature females, 27.1, 33.8, 35.8, little fat to fat.
The absence of adult males in our sample of 15 birds is noteworthy but inexplicable
with our few data.</p>

<p><i>Regulus s. satrapa.</i> Golden-crowned Kinglet.&mdash;Weights: 1 adult male,
6.7, moderately fat; 2 immature males, 6.5, 7.4, moderately fat and fat; 2 adult
females, 7.3, 7.4, moderately fat and fat; 1 immature female, 7.2, moderately
fat.</p>

<p><i>Regulus c. calendula.</i> Ruby-crowned Kinglet.&mdash;Weights: 3 adult males,
6.2, 7.6, 8.2, little fat to fat; 1 immature male, 6.6, fat; 4 adult females, mean
6.1 (5.6-6.7), moderately fat to fat; 3 immature females, 5.8, 6.6, 7.0, moderately
fat to fat.</p>

<p><i>Vireo flavifrons.</i> Yellow-throated Vireo.&mdash;Weight: 1 immature male, 21.5,
very fat.</p>

<p><i>Vireo s. solitarius.</i> Blue-headed Vireo.&mdash;Weights: 9 adult males, mean
17.7 (16.6-19.5), little fat to very fat; 17 immature males, mean 17.53 &plusmn; .46,
S. D. 1.83, no fat (13.8) to very fat (21.3); 7 adult females, mean 17.6 (15.0-21.6),
moderately fat to very fat; 6 immature females, mean 17.0 (14.5-18.9),
moderately fat to fat. Surprisingly numerous in the sample.</p>

<p><i>Vireo olivaceus.</i> Red-eyed Vireo.&mdash;Weights: 1 adult male, 16.1, moderately
fat; 38 immature males, mean 21.21 &plusmn; .43, S. D. 2.60, little fat (1
specimen) to excessively fat, mostly moderately fat or fat; 2 adult females,
18.1, 18.1, both fat; 23 immature females, mean 19.28 &plusmn; .46, S. D. 2.16, little
(2 specimens) to very fat, mostly fat.</p>

<p>Wing length: 1 adult male, 79.1; 38 immature males, mean 78.05 &plusmn; .30,
S. D. 1.80; 2 adult females, 76.3, 79.0, 23 immature females, mean 75.83 &plusmn;
.42, S. D. 1.99.</p>

<p>As mentioned below, the presence of only 3 adults in the sample of 64
Red-eyed Vireos is highly significant and their occurrence only in the earlier
samples is strong evidence of early migration by the adults.</p>

<p><i>Vireo philadelphicus.</i> Philadelphia Vireo.&mdash;Weights: 2 adult males, 12.1,
15.9, moderately fat and very fat; 2 immature males, 11.1, 13.2, fat and very
fat; 2 adult females, 13.1, 14.2, both fat; 5 immature females, mean 14.1
(12.0-15.2), moderately fat to very fat.</p>

<p>This species previously has been collected in Kansas only twice. Both
records are from Doniphan County in September, 1922. Field observers occasionally
record the Philadelphia Vireo in eastern Kansas. Long (1940:450)
calls it a "very rare migrant in the extreme east." Our sample of 12 birds
killed on two nights (and probably after the peak of migration of this species)
leads us to think that this vireo is actually a regular, but overlooked, migrant
in fair numbers.</p>

<p><i>Vireo g. gilvus.</i> Warbling Vireo.&mdash;Weights: 12 adult males, mean 15.92
&plusmn; .43, S. D. 1.44, moderately fat to very fat; 8 immature males, mean 16.64
(14.2-17.8), fat to very fat; 5 adult females, mean 16.1 (13.7-18.0), fat to
very fat; 5 immature females, mean 15.4 (14.1-17.8), little fat to fat.</p>

<p>Wing length: 12 adult males, mean 73.08 &plusmn; .49, S. D. 1.64; 8 immature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>males, mean 71.15 (69.9-72.8); 5 adult females, mean 70.0 (69.2-71.0); 5
immature females, mean 68.4 (67.7-70.3).</p>

<p>Tail length: 12 adult males, mean 53.33 &plusmn; .53, S. D. 1.77; 8 immature
males, mean 50.03 (47.1-51.3); 4 adult females, mean 48.6 (47.7-49.8); 5 immature
females, mean 49.2 (47.3-53.0).</p>

<p>There is no indication that western birds (<i>V. g. swainsonii</i>) make up any
part of this sample.</p>

<p>The sample of 34 Warbling Vireos is too small to show the significance, if
any, of the 2:1 ratio of males to females in the sample. Adequate samples of
this species, taken at intervals, would add interesting information on time of
migration of the four sex- and age-classes.</p>

<p><i>Mniotilta varia.</i> Black and White Warbler.&mdash;Weights: 1 adult male, 12.5,
fat; 2 adult females, 10.0, 10.0, little fat, fat.</p>

<p><i>Vermivora peregrina.</i> Tennessee Warbler.&mdash;Weights: 1 adult male, 10.9,
very fat; 1 immature male, 12.9, very fat; 2 adult females, 9.1, 12.5, moderately
fat and very fat. The relative scarcity of Tennessee Warblers in the
sample is surprising. They are common in the area in spring.</p>

<p><i>Vermivora c. celata.</i> Orange-crowned Warbler.&mdash;Weights: 9 adult males,
mean 8.8 (7.7-10.9), little fat to fat; 13 immature males, mean 8.92 &plusmn; .15,
S. D. .53, little fat to fat; 5 adult females, mean 8.8 (8.3-10.3), little fat to
moderately fat; 17 immature females, mean 9.13 &plusmn; .08, S. D. .72, little fat to
fat. Of the 19 Orange-crowned Warblers killed on October 7, 11 had little
fat, 6 were moderately fat, and only 2 were fat. No one-night sample of any
other warbler killed at Topeka had less fat than this group of warblers. Furthermore,
our sample (including 11 males) from October 7 (all sex- and age-classes)
averaged 8.81 grams; the sample of 13 (including only 4 males) from
October 1 averaged 9.1 grams. If one can assume, for any one species, that
individuals undertake nocturnal migration only when they are physiologically
ready, and this includes a certain amount of fat as a fuel source (Wolfson,
1954), then this further assumption seems justified: birds killed in migration
with little fat must have flown longer or farther or both than birds killed with
more fat. No further speculation on this point is permissible with our data,
but the possibilities for study of future large kills, especially where actual time
of death of the birds is known, are obvious.</p>

<p><i>Vermivora r. ruficapilla.</i> Nashville Warbler.&mdash;More Nashville Warblers
were picked up at Topeka than any other species and they are discussed in
detail elsewhere in this report. The four sex- and age-classes can be identified
with fair accuracy on plumage characteristics alone. Adult males have a
large amount of reddish-brown in the crown, not completely veiled by the
gray tips of the crown feathers. Immature males have a smaller but distinct
crown patch, usually completely veiled. All males, compared with females, are
grayer on the sides of the head, have a more nearly white eye-ring, and show
clearer yellow on the throat. Adult females differ from immature females in
that they more often have a trace of rufous in the crown and tend to be
brighter below than the immatures. Of 177 specimens, 20 were very fat, 108
were fat, 46 were moderately fat, and 3 had little fat.</p>

<p><i>Parula americana.</i> Parula Warbler.&mdash;Weight: 1 adult female, 7.9, fat.</p>

<p><i>Dendroica petechia aestiva.</i> Yellow Warbler.&mdash;Weights: 1 immature male,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>10.2, fat; 3 adult females, 8.8, 9.5, 10.1, moderately fat; 2 immature females,
9.0, 9.4, little fat and fat.</p>

<p><i>Dendroica magnolia.</i> Magnolia Warbler.&mdash;Weights: 1 adult female, 9.0,
moderately fat; 2 immature females, 7.9, 10.3, moderately fat and fat.</p>

<p><i>Dendroica c. caerulescens.</i> Black-throated Blue Warbler.&mdash;Weights: 2
immature males, 13.8, 14.1, excessively fat; 1 immature female, 11.4, fat.
This species is rare in Kansas. Although its breeding range is almost entirely
east and north of Kansas, records in files at the University of Kansas show
that more specimens have been taken in western than in eastern Kansas.</p>

<p><i>Dendroica c. coronata.</i> Myrtle Warbler.&mdash;Weight: 1 immature female,
11.6, fat.</p>

<p><i>Dendroica pensylvanica.</i> Chestnut-sided Warbler.&mdash;Weights: 2 immature
females, 8.1, 10.0, little fat. Only one specimen from Kansas had been preserved
previously although the species is a regular transient in small numbers
throughout the state.</p>

<p><i>Dendroica castanea.</i> Bay-breasted Warbler.&mdash;Weights: 1 adult male, 19.2,
excessively fat; 1 adult female, 11.7, little fat; 1 immature female, 11.2, moderately
fat. Only 5 specimens of this warbler have been taken previously in
Kansas, 4 in spring (Ruth, 1952:18-19) and 1 in fall.</p>

<p><i>Dendroica p. palmarum.</i> Palm Warbler.&mdash;Weights: 2 immature males,
9.9, 10.9, moderately fat; 2 unsexed immatures, 9.1, 9.4, moderately fat. This
species has been taken in fall in Kansas only once before (KU 26353, taken
by Wetmore, at Lawrence, on October 5, 1907), but probably occurs regularly
in both spring and fall migration.</p>

<p><i>Seiurus a. aurocapillus.</i> Oven-bird.&mdash;Weights: 2 adult males, 22.5, 23.8,
fat and very fat; 14 immature males, mean 21.89 &plusmn; .66, S. D. 2.46, fat to very
fat; 8 adult females, mean 21.4 (18.3-25.7), moderately fat to fat; 6 immature
females, mean 18.2 (15.6-20.0), moderately fat to fat.</p>

<p><i>Seiurus noveboracensis notabilis.</i> Northern Water-thrush.&mdash;Weights: 3
immature males, 18.1, 18.6, 22.2, moderately fat to fat; 1 immature female,
22.2, fat. Referring these birds to <i>notabilis</i> is a somewhat arbitrary procedure.
They display some intermediacy of characters and probably stem from a
population, intermediate between <i>notabilis</i> and <i>noveboracensis</i>, occupying
much of central North America (cf. McCabe and Miller, 1933).</p>

<p><i>Oporornis philadelphia.</i> Mourning Warbler.&mdash;Weight data presented elsewhere.
The birds killed at Topeka provide the latest fall dates for this species
in Kansas. Fifteen were killed on September 25, 64 on October 1, 2 on
October 5, 11 on October 6, 2 on October 7, and 1 on October 8. We find
no other records later than September 15. Of 93 specimens examined, 1 was
excessively fat, 22 were very fat, 45 were fat, 21 were moderately fat, and 4
had little fat. The abundance of this secretive species in the sample was a
great surprise. It had previously been considered a rather rare migrant in
this area.</p>

<p><i>Geothlypis trichas occidentalis [&gt;brachidactyla?].</i> Yellow-throat.&mdash;Weight
data presented elsewhere. This species was second in numbers only to the
Nashville Warbler in the total kill at Topeka. Of 167 birds examined, 29
were very fat, 114 were fat, 23 were moderately fat, and 1 had little fat.</p>

<p>The Yellow-throats are greatly in need of meaningful and comprehensive
revision, which to date has been restricted to the western subspecies (Behle,
1950). Since the appearance of the 1931 A. O. U. Check-List a great deal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>of scattered taxonomic work on the species, as yet unsynthesized, has made
the picture of its geographic variation a blurry one so far as the details are
concerned. Made in the absence of adequate comparative material, the above
identification is to be regarded as tentative. Also, it is, unfortunately, based
only on those 6 of our 176 specimens preserved as skins. Five of these are
adult males, the sixth being an immature female. Compared with a series of
Kentucky specimens regarded as typical <i>brachidactyla</i>, these birds are paler
and brighter above (tending toward gray-green rather than brownish olive),
brighter and more extensively yellow below, with broader, more nearly white
superciliary stripes above their black masks (in males). In size they are
close to <i>occidentalis</i> (see Behle, 1950:202). Five males have an average
wing-length of 56.6 mm. (53-59); one female measures 53. Six males from
Kentucky: 55.1 (53-56); four females, 51.1 (48-56). Our birds may be assumed
to have stemmed from a population to the north and west which, if
not <i>occidentalis</i> (or <i>campicola</i> Behle and Aldrich, of which no comparative
material is at hand), is intermediate between <i>brachidactyla</i> and more western
birds. Judging from Behle's map (1950:fig. 32), these birds may have come
from an area near the confluence of three subspecies (<i>campicola</i>, <i>occidentalis</i>,
<i>brachidactyla</i>). Long (1940:452) reports three subspecies breeding in Kansas
(<i>brachidactyla</i>, northeast; <i>occidentalis</i>, west; <i>trichas</i>, southeast). The occurrence
in Kansas of <i>G. t. trichas</i> as currently understood is completely out of
the question.</p>

<p><i>Icteria v. virens.</i> Yellow-breasted Chat.&mdash;Weight: 1 unsexed immature,
29.7, moderately fat.</p>

<p><i>Wilsonia p. pusilla.</i> Wilson Warbler.&mdash;Weights: 2 adult females, 7.5, 7.8,
fat, moderately fat; 1 unsexed adult, 8.3, fat.</p>

<p><i>Wilsonia canadensis.</i> Canada Warbler.&mdash;Weight: 1 immature female, 10.0,
little fat. We know of only five other specimens from Kansas, although this
warbler seems to be a regular migrant in small numbers in the state.</p>

<p><i>Setophaga r. ruticilla.</i> American Redstart.&mdash;Weight: 1 immature female,
9.1, moderately fat.</p>

<p><i>Dolichonyx oryzivorus.</i> Bobolink.&mdash;Weights: 2 adult females, 39.5, 42.9;
2 immature females, 38.8, 42.0; all excessively fat. Specimens of the Bobolink
previously have been taken in fall in Kansas only on September 20 and 24,
1933, near Lawrence, by Long and Preble (Long, 1934).</p>

<p><i>Pheucticus ludovicianus.</i> Rose-breasted Grosbeak.&mdash;Weights: 1 adult male,
50.4, fat; one immature male, 54.5, very fat.</p>

<p><i>Passerina cyanea.</i> Indigo Bunting.&mdash;Weights: 1 adult male, 18.4, fat; 2
immature males, 17.2, 17.2, fat and very fat; 2 adult females, 14.3, 16.9, moderately
fat and very fat; 1 immature female, 13.4, little fat. The sample was
carefully checked for Lazuli Buntings (<i>Passerina amoena</i>); none was found.</p>

<p><i>Spiza americana.</i> Dickcissel.&mdash;Weight data presented elsewhere in this
paper. Dickcissels were picked up at the television tower on October 1 (31),
5 (1), 6 (3), and 7 (1). These birds, together with an adult female taken
3 miles east and 3 miles south of Lawrence, on October 11, 1953, by Tordoff,
are the only specimens of this species taken as late as October in Kansas. The
Dickcissel becomes inconspicuous in late summer and many observers here and
elsewhere have thought the species disappeared much earlier than it really
does (see Ganier, 1949). Of 34 specimens, 20 were very fat and 14 were fat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Passerculus sandwichensis nevadensis.</i> Savannah Sparrow.&mdash;Weights: 1
adult male, 19.4, fat; 2 immature males, 18.3, 19.0, moderately fat; 5 adult
females, mean 17.2 (14.8-19.5), little fat to fat; 4 immature females, mean
18.0 (16.9-19.6), moderately fat to fat. Many of the Savannah Sparrows migrating
through Kansas have in the past been referred to the subspecies <i>P. s.
anthinus</i> (= <i>alaudinus</i> of the 1931 A. O. U. Check-List) by various workers
(see Long, 1940:454). As Peters and Griscom (1938:464-5) have shown,
true <i>anthinus</i>, breeding in the far northwest, ordinarily occurs in migration
only in the western part of the country, the breeding Savannah Sparrows of
a large part of the central continental region (east to southern Wisconsin)
being <i>P. s. nevadensis</i> as now understood. Migrants of this pale, clay-colored
subspecies should be abundant in Kansas, and all of the specimens in the
present sample are referable to it.</p>

<p><i>Ammodramus savannarum perpallidus.</i> Grasshopper Sparrow.&mdash;Weights:
3 adult males, 16.4, 17.6, 20.6, moderately fat, fat, fat; 5 immature males,
mean 18.1 (16.0-20.2), little fat to fat; 5 adult females, mean 17.9 (16.8-18.9),
moderately fat to very fat; 5 immature females, mean 18.1 (16.8-20.6),
fat to very fat.</p>

<p><i>Passerherbulus caudacutus.</i> Leconte Sparrow.&mdash;Weights: 1 immature male,
11.2, moderately fat; 1 immature female, 12.2, moderately fat.</p>

<p><i>Ammospiza caudacuta nelsoni.</i> Sharp-tailed Sparrow.&mdash;Weights: 2 adult
males, 15.2, 17.1, moderately fat and very fat; 1 adult female, 13.3, little fat.
Five specimens of this species have been taken previously in Kansas, all in
October in the eastern part of the state. Additionally, several observers have
reported birds seen but not collected. The three birds from Topeka were
picked up on October 6, 7, and 10 and are the only specimens taken since
1907. Possibly our specimens from Topeka struck the tower on the same night.
Tordoff noticed, upon preparation, that the specimens from October 7 and 10
showed progressive drying of the extremities and spoilage as compared with the
bird picked up on October 6.</p>

<p><i>Junco hyemalis cismontanus.</i> Slate-colored Junco.&mdash;Weight: 1 immature
female, 16.4, little fat. Juncos of hybrid type, whether <i>J. h. hyemalis</i> &times; <i>J.
oreganus</i> subsp. or true <i>J. h. cismontanus</i>, are fairly common in eastern Kansas.</p>

<p><i>Spizella pallida.</i> Clay-colored Sparrow.&mdash;Weights: 2 adult males, 11.6,
12.2, both fat; 1 immature male, 11.8, fat; 1 adult female, 12.5, fat; 7 immature
females, mean 11.1 (9.7-12.5), little fat to fat.</p>

<p><i>Passerella iliaca iliaca.</i> Fox Sparrow.&mdash;Weight: 1 adult female, 29.4, little
fat. A trifle grayer above than any of several Kentucky specimens, this bird
nevertheless seems well within the range of variation of <i>iliaca</i>.</p>

<p><i>Melospiza l. lincolnii.</i> Lincoln Sparrow.&mdash;Weights and measurements are
discussed elsewhere. Of 81 specimens, 15 were very fat, 47 were fat, 12 were
moderately fat, and 7 had little fat. Interestingly, there is no evidence that
the large southern montane subspecies (<i>M. l. alticola</i>) has contributed to the
present sample. No bimodality is evident in the curve of wing-length in our
birds, the largest of which barely approach, the small extreme recorded for
<i>alticola</i> by Miller and McCabe (1935:156).</p>

<p><i>Melospiza georgiana ericrypta.</i> Swamp Sparrow.&mdash;Weights: 3 immature
females, 14.3, little fat, 16.7, 17.0, moderately fat. Swamp Sparrows examined
were all more or less brightly colored and seem to belong to this northern subspecies.</p>

<p><i>Melospiza melodia juddi.</i> Song Sparrow.&mdash;Weights: 1 adult female, 19.4,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>little fat; 1 unsexed immature, 16.0, little fat. A large proportion of the migrant
and wintering Song Sparrows in eastern Kansas probably originate from
the range of this subspecies in the northern plains. <i>Melospiza melodia euphonia.</i>&mdash;One
immature female (not weighed) was picked up below the tower
on October 27, 1954, and thus does not appear in Table 1. The specimen
proved typical of this generally more eastern subspecies upon comparison with
a large series from Kentucky. For what it may be worth we refer the single
specimen to this subspecies. Long (1940:456) reported two eastern subspecies
from Kansas ("<i>beata</i>," <i>melodia</i>). All Kansas specimens genuinely of
eastern origin probably originate from the range of <i>euphonia</i>, as now understood.</p></blockquote>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Randomness of the Sample</h2>


<p>The reliability of certain of the conclusions which might be
drawn from data of the kind presented herein depends largely on
the randomness of the sample. To what degree does this sample
provide a true cross-section of the nocturnal migrants present over
the area on a given night or succession of nights? As far as the
relative abundance of species in the sample is concerned, there is
little doubt that it is not at all random. The absence of such species
as the Gray-cheeked Thrush (<i>Hylocichla minima</i>), among the
passerines, and many of the shorebirds known to be migrating
through the area at the time is evidence for this statement. Quite
possibly many seminocturnal species did not strike the tower at all
for the simple reason that they could see it, and certain large-eyed
diurnal species (such as thrushes and shorebirds) may avoid collision
to some extent, thus not appearing in the sample in proportion
to their actual numbers. Finally, some or all of the species concerned
probably migrate partly by day. The sample may to some
degree reflect the true relative abundance of closely related species.
For example, there is little doubt that, as shown by the sample,
Nashville Warblers are more numerous locally at this season than
Tennessee Warblers, a fact that can readily be corroborated by
ordinary field observation. Also, the sample is useful in suggesting
the actual abundance of species which are furtive and/or difficult
to identify under normal field conditions, for example, the Mourning
Warbler and Philadelphia Vireo. It is obvious that the sample
should reflect the true relative abundance at one place and time
of any two species with equal tendency to migrate by night and
equal tendency to strike the tower. Since the facts in regard to
both tendencies are at present unknown for most species, we think
that interspecific comparisons should be avoided or approached
with extreme caution.</p>

<p>In respect to the relative abundance of the various sex- and
age-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>classes within a given species, the sample is, we think, as close to
random as is possible to obtain. Certainly it is greatly superior to
samples obtained by field collecting, where possible differences in
habits, wariness, and experience of the birds, and subconscious (if
not conscious) selection by collectors can all bias the results.
Dwight (1900:128-9) believed that the greater wariness of adult
birds was almost entirely responsible for the seemingly disproportionate
number of immatures in autumn and gave some observational
evidence in favor of his views. The large percentage of
adults in some of the samples here treated tends to reinforce
Dwight's position. To a somewhat lesser extent, this advantage in
randomness of accidental kills over routine collecting may be supposed
to apply also in demonstrating the composition by subspecies
of a single migrant species.</p>

<p>So far as particulars already mentioned are concerned, the present
sample or other samples of tower-killed birds would seem to be in
no way superior (that is, more nearly random) to samples obtained
in connection with lighthouses and other lighted objects, and
ceilometers. In one important respect, however, it is probably
somewhat superior to these as the dimly red-lighted structure has
not been shown to have any important collecting or attracting influence.
Thus, in computations intended to estimate the over-all
abundance of migrants, the sample should be more reliable than
samples involving bright light with its possible attracting effect.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Number of Migrants</h2>


<p>If it can be assumed that nocturnally migrating birds are approximately
uniformly spaced across the sky and that the red lights did
not attract birds which would otherwise have missed the tower, it
is possible to compute the volume of migration from the sample
killed. In regard to the first assumption, both Stone (1906:250-251)
and Lowery (1951:409-413) have presented evidence of fairly uniform
distribution of nocturnal migrants. We have no information
on the second assumption beyond the facts that birds do not strike
the high towers on clear nights or lower towers even on stormy
nights.</p>

<p>On nights when large numbers of birds struck the 950 foot Topeka
tower, only a few struck a 500 foot radio tower, also lighted
with red lights, at Lawrence, 24 miles east, under similar weather
conditions. Most of the birds found at Topeka were fairly close
to the base of the tower, indicating that they struck the tower itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
or that they were flying high enough to strike guy wires only fairly
close to the tower. The scarcity of birds under the guy wires some
distance from the tower at Topeka and at the radio tower at Lawrence
causes us to think that most of the birds were flying more
than 450 feet above the ground. On this basis, we have computed
numbers of migrants passing through a plane one mile long and
500 feet high (2,640,000 square feet), intersecting the assumed path
of migration at right angles. Vertically, the theoretical plane begins
at 450 feet above ground and has its top edge at 950 feet. The
solid (discounting spaces between girders, <i>etc.</i>) cross-sectional area
of the tower intersecting this plane was computed by actual measurement
to be 1685 square feet. On the night of September 30-October
1, 585 birds were killed. By computation (585/1685 =
X/2,640,000), approximately 916,000 birds passed through the mile-long
plane that night. On each of the nights of October 5-6 and
October 6-7, approximately 230,000 birds passed through this plane.
By comparison, Lowery (1951:436) recorded maximum station
densities in one night in spring of 63,600 birds at Tampico, Mexico,
and 51,600 at Lawrence, Kansas, as determined by moon-watching.
Lowery's figures refer to numbers of birds crossing any part of a
circle one mile in diameter and are roughly comparable to ours if,
as we think, most of the birds at Topeka were flying at altitudes between
450 and 950 feet above the ground.</p>

<p>It must be realized that these figures are only approximations.
One variable ignored is the frontal extent (or area, viewed from the
front, subject to damage by striking an obstruction) of the birds
themselves. Since practically all birds killed showed head or trunk
injuries, rather than a high proportion with only broken wings, we
chose to disregard frontal extent of the birds in our calculations.
If our figures are inaccurate by as much as 50 per cent in either
direction, which seems unlikely to us, they still give some idea of
the tremendous volume of nocturnal migration under some conditions.</p>

<p>It may be more meaningful to compute numbers of migrants by
species. This can be done readily by making appropriate substitutions
from Table 1 in the equation given above. For example,
on the night of September 30-October 1, approximately 147,000
Nashville Warblers passed through the mile-long plane and on the
same night, 100,000 Mourning Warblers and 14,000 Philadelphia
Vireos. Neither of the last two species would be judged to be
abundant migrants in autumn in eastern Kansas by ordinary field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
observations; the television tower sample, however, indicates that
these as well as other species must often be overlooked when they
do stop in Kansas.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Differential Migration of Sex- and Age-classes</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">History of the Subject.</span>&mdash;For a long time it has been known in
a general way that old and young birds and males and females of
some species do not always migrate at the same times, by the same
routes, or even to the same places. This is a subject about which
much has been written. Reading the summaries of some general
texts, it is easy to acquire the impression that the facts of the matter
are well known. On the contrary, they are poorly known and much
remains to be learned before differential migration is understood.
This can best be indicated by a brief survey of the literature.</p>

<p>The importance of the subject was emphasized by Meinertzhagen
(1930:52) in one of the later reviews of differential migration:
"The main problem concerns the Cause of Migration, the
Stimulus which compels Migration and the Origin of the Migratory
Habit.... There is, however, a minor problem which affords
valuable evidence in helping us to solve the major problem, bearing
very directly on it, namely, the order of sex and age on migration."</p>

<p>The mystery of how birds, especially the young, find their way
in migration has fascinated students since the earliest times. The
quite natural though purely anthropomorphic conclusion of early
scholars was that the old birds led the young on migration. This
attractive idea persisted long after ornithology began to grow into
a science. The classic theory was restated by Palm&eacute;n (1876:267),
in one of the first thorough reviews of the subject of migration, as
follows: "Directe Beobachtungen in der Natur ergeben, dass die
Schaaren von ziehenden V&ouml;geln allgemein &auml;ltere und st&auml;rkere Individuen
als Anf&uuml;hrer des Zuges haben." Variously modified, this
view continued to crop up for some time and still found support in
the 1890's (see Dixon, 1892:69). G&auml;tke (1895:101) correctly questioned
the credibility of Palm&eacute;n's "direct observations."</p>

<p>With the gradual abandonment of the unsupportable classic
theory, diametrically opposed views were adopted by workers on
opposite sides of the Atlantic. The American stand was ably expressed
by Brewster (1886), who went to great pains to state his
case and give evidence, and who was later supported by Allen
(1896:144-147; 1909:17). The Americans held that adult birds
nearly always preceded the young in migration, and this was based
on much evidence, whether or not correctly interpreted. Dwight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
(1900:127) also gave evidence in favor of this theory. Equally
definite, if, as has later been shown, somewhat vaguely documented,
was the famous work of G&auml;tke (1895:see pp. 100-113), who after
many years' observation of migrant birds in Heligoland concluded
the exact opposite, that young in general precede adults (see critiques
of Allen, 1896:144-147; Wiegold, 1926:5). G&auml;tke's dissenting
opinion was for a time supported enthusiastically by British
workers (Gurney, 1923:579-580).</p>

<p>As so often happens, neither extreme has withstood the test of
time, and more recent summaries (Meinertzhagen, 1930:55-56;
Thomson, 1926, 1936:488-489; Wiegold, 1926) have tended to compromise.
Many exceptions to G&auml;tke's extreme conclusion have been
detected. Exceptions to the Brewster-Allen stand have also been
discovered, although work along these lines on the American side
has lagged somewhat. Rowan (1926) has given further evidence
on the migration of certain shorebirds, and some evidence has accrued
in relation to particular species and groups as a result of
life-history and banding studies (see Pitelka, 1946). Authors of
major works on migration, however, have either been preoccupied
with other phases of migration or avoided the issue. In an able
study (one of several on related subjects) of the composition by sex
and age of migrant populations in north Germany, Drost (1935:177)
did not go into the question of order on migration.</p>

<p>One is left with the impression that the whole subject is still unsettled.
While earlier workers sought to reduce the entire matter
to law, the latest disclaim the possibility of generalization. After
summarizing Brewster's and G&auml;tke's opinions, Thomson (1926:79)
wrote: "It would seem, in any event, that no general rule can be
laid down." Meinertzhagen's summation (1930:56-57) still represents
fairly well the status of our knowledge: "Order of sex and
age on autumn passage is very difficult to arrive at, as evidence is
conflicting. But, on the whole, it seems that birds flock together,
old and young, preparatory to moving south, and do in many cases
initiate migration in company.... But once movement is initiated,
among birds which do not habitually fraternise in flocks,
adults, and especially males, will naturally outstrip the less virile
females and still less virile offspring.... The consequence is
that any observer at an intermediate station such as Heligoland is,
in noting birds of the year as first arrivals, has not had an
opportunity of noting the flocks of adults which have passed without
alighting. On the other hand, there is very definite evidence to
show that among certain species, adults follow their offspring on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
migration. The reason for different behaviour among different types
of birds remains obscure." We regard much of this as still theory.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to imagine a better way of resolving the
problems and uncertainties just reviewed than by the detailed analy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>sis
of large samples of migratory birds killed at random at various
points and times. An analysis of the sample of birds accidentally
killed at Topeka is presented here as an initial step in this direction.
Although the conclusions based on this sample are tentative and
may in time be altered, the data themselves are definite. If this
general type of analysis is repeated again and again&mdash;applied to
samples taken on many dates and in many localities&mdash;a mass of
hitherto unparalleled evidence for the study of migration will
emerge.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Differential Migration OF Sex- and Age-classes as shown by
the Topeka Sample.</span>&mdash;Smaller samples have not been treated.
Species affording samples seemingly large enough to justify at least
preliminary analysis were: Catbird, Red-eyed Vireo, Mourning
Warbler, Dickcissel, Nashville Warbler, Orange-crowned Warbler,
Yellow-throat, and Lincoln Sparrow (Fig. 1). For all of these except
the Catbird and Dickcissel, at least two samples from a week
or more apart were available for comparison in an effort to detect
trends in migration. Fig. 1 shows the actual ratios of sex- and age-classes
observed in samples of the species listed above. Each of
the last four species provided two separate samples, of sufficient
size to warrant an attempt at measuring the statistical significance
of the observed changes in adult-immature ratios (Table 2).</p>

<p>Upon the application of statistical methods it soon became evident
that, unless changes in ratio between two samples are marked,
large samples would be required in order to reach conclusions of
high statistical significance in a single study of the present type. In
this case (see Table 2), the Lincoln Sparrow and Orange-crowned
Warbler, though represented by only moderate-sized series, show
marked changes in age composition over the period studied, and
the statistical treatment indicates a high degree of probability that
these changes are real. Assurance that the lesser changes observed
in the Nashville Warbler and Yellow-throat are real, on the other
hand, is much less, even though the samples are larger. Few if any
of the samples here discussed are as large as might be desired.
Therefore, conclusions based upon them (see below) are to be regarded
as tentative. Many other, future, samples will perhaps also
be insufficient in size in themselves. There are, however, statistical
advantages to repetition which will serve to make the repeated
analysis even of small samples significant and valuable.</p>

<p>Certain of the samples not treated statistically show ratios that
can be seen by inspection to be probably significant. For example
the almost complete absence of adults from the three samples of
Red-eyed Vireos (Fig. 1E) cannot be disregarded in view of the
size of the whole sample of the species. The same applies to the
high percentage of adult females and the near absence of adult
males in the sample of the Dickcissel (Fig. 1F). The continuity
in direction of changes observed in the three samples of the Mourning
Warbler (Fig. 1G) and Red-eyed Vireo is likewise probably
significant, even though some of the samples compared are small.
It seems to us that the application of statistical methods to these
species should await the accumulation of more material. For anyone
desiring to treat them statistically now, the data are inherent
in this paper.</p>

<p>We have not computed the standard errors of the ratios of sexes
within age groups (except experimentally in a few cases). This
can easily be done, however, and the significance of a given ratio
determined, on the assumption (perhaps sometimes dubiously justifiable)
that the sex-ratio in the species concerned is one:one. Obviously
there is no point in computation of the standard errors of
adult-immature ratios in single samples (such as that of the Dickcissel)
until the actual ratio prevailing in the species in nature at
the season in question is known for comparison with the observed
ratio. Our formal statistical treatment, therefore, has been limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
to an examination of the significance of the <i>changes</i> between adult-immature
ratios in samples of the same species taken a number of
days apart.</p>

<p>The samples suggest several patterns of differential migration of
sex- and age-classes. Indeed, the important consideration brought
out&mdash;in our opinion not hitherto sufficiently emphasized in literature&mdash;seems
to be that in generalizing about adults and immatures,
one must be careful to take sexes into account, and conversely, in
generalizing about males and females, one must consider also age.
In other words, there are really four classes to be considered. This
poses additional problems in analysis and introduces the need for
still larger samples in order to reach significant conclusions. To
illustrate: an adult-immature ratio of 40:20 (N = 60) may be satisfactorily
significant, while within the 40 adults a ratio of 25
males:15 females may not be. Were the original sample 80:40
(N = 120) with male adults 50 and female adults 30, it is obvious
that the significance of the latter ratio would be greater. The same
applies in reverse if the greater emphasis is placed on sex and the
lesser on age. Because of the moderate size of the samples this
problem has been felt in the present study in respect to sex ratios
within age groups, many of which must at present be regarded as
of tentative significance.</p>

<p>In short, what the earlier ornithologists regarded as a simple problem
is in reality a complex one. There are only two patterns in
what may be called the Brewster-G&auml;tke argument: adults first or
immatures first (with of course the further possibility of both at the
same time). Both patterns occur, as is now known, at least to some
extent. But actual patterns, as suggested by our samples, are more
complex when all classes are considered. It will readily be seen
that, if adult males, immature males, adult females, and immature
females be regarded as units, each with certain migratory characteristics,
the combinations of these units in various orders of migratory
precedence are potentially numerous. In fact, of course,
they do not behave strictly as units (or perhaps very rarely so),
but our data strongly indicate that the tendency exists in many
cases. This may be stated another way. The present samples may
be reduced to two basic patterns, fitting the classic early American
(adults first) and early European (immatures first) theories. But,
either such simple arrangement is compounded in some, perhaps in
truth in all, instances by differential migration of the sexes <i>within</i>
each age class. This proposition can also be stated backwards:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the samples show differential times of migration of the sexes, compounded
by differential times of migration of the age groups within
each sex. The order in which these matters are approached depends
on what one is trying to find out. Influenced by the literature,
in which most emphasis has been placed on age, we have approached
the problem from that standpoint. The data and figures
here given, however, can be juggled if one wishes to place first
emphasis on the order of sexes in migration.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind what has just been said, particularly in respect
to sizes of samples necessary for significance, let us consider the
patterns of migration suggested by the Topeka sample. These are
as follows:</p>

<p>(1) <i>An early migration largely composed of adults, giving way
later on to a preponderance of immatures.</i> Regardless of variations
among them, samples showing this basic pattern are in line with
the opinions of Brewster (1886) and his followers. This pattern
is here shown by the Lincoln Sparrow, Yellow-throat, Nashville
Warbler, Catbird (one sample only), and Red-eyed Vireo (Fig. 1,
A, B, C, D, E). The evidence of these and all other samples would
admittedly be more conclusive if the samples were further apart in
time or, better still, were there more of them. There is evidence
that differences in migration of the sexes, within age classes, influence
this pattern, sharply in some instances. In the later samples
of Lincoln Sparrow, Yellow-throat, and Red-eyed Vireo (Fig. 1,
A, B, E) there are relatively fewer males, both adult and immature,
than in the earlier samples and this may be true also of the Catbird,
judging from the single sample. The Red-eyed Vireo (Fig.
1, E) is characterized by small number, or absence of, males in
each sample but the samples are not significantly different, and can
be regarded as one. Although the samples of the Dickcissel and
Mourning Warbler (Fig. 1, F, G) show a somewhat different over-all
pattern and are discussed further on, they also contain few adult
males. Since these samples are from a period that is near the end
of the migration of Red-eyed Vireos, Mourning Warblers, and Dickcissels,
it may be assumed tentatively that the adult males have
already migrated. Meinertzhagen (1930:56) postulated that in
many species there is an earlier or more rapid migration of adults,
particularly males, and the data for the above species in our sample
tend to support his assumption. But our data suggest in addition
that in some species <i>immature males</i> migrate earlier, or more rapidly,
than do <i>immature females</i>, just as adult males precede adult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
females in some instances. Within this general pattern (adults
first) another variation is shown by the Nashville Warbler (Fig. 1,
C) in which the later sample of adults is heavily weighted towards
males, even though an increasing over-all proportion of immatures
is evidenced. In this case, and contrary to Meinertzhagen's suggestion,
it would seem that adult females have preceded or outstripped
adult males in migration.</p>

<p>(2) <i>An early preponderance of immatures, followed by a preponderance
of adults.</i> The several species of birds at Topeka that
display this pattern conform with the conclusions of G&auml;tke and
other early Old World ornithologists that in most species immatures
precede adults in migration. In the present sample two variations
of this pattern occur.</p>

<p>(a) In the Dickcissel (Fig. 1, F) and the Mourning Warbler
(Fig. 1, G), immatures decrease more markedly than adults (visible
in samples of Mourning Warbler; inferred in Dickcissel), leaving
the adults in the majority in the closing phase of migration. The
distinctive and interesting feature in each of these two species is
the ascendancy in numbers of adults <i>despite</i> the almost complete
disappearance of adult males. The relative increase of adults is
here caused by a retarded migration of adult females, which linger
conspicuously behind all other classes. Something of this nature
was suggested, in theory, by Dixon (1892:70) who thought that
adult females are delayed by "maternal duties." It was hinted at
also by Dwight (1900:127) who thought that in some species females
molted later than males as a result of prolongation of parental
responsibilities. As mentioned already, there is need for caution
in interpreting the present samples because the Dickcissel is represented
only by one sample and two of the three samples of Mourning
Warblers are small. In the case of the Mourning Warbler, the
samples may be regarded as one, nearly lacking in adult males.
The progressive increase of adult females, however, may be significant;
at least there are enough of these to make division of the
birds into three samples enlightening. There is, of course, some
chance that the majority of adult males have not yet migrated, or
are migrating by a different route. This seems unlikely in both
cases. October 1 is late in the migration of the Dickcissel and it
seems that large-scale migration would not occur much later, and
in the case of the Mourning Warbler adult males are rare in all
three samples, extending over a considerable period and reaching
late into the probable migration period of the species. It is
inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>esting to conjecture just when and where adult male Mourning
Warblers do migrate in autumn. Brewster (1886:16) wrote: "This
species arrives at Cambridge [Massachusetts] about September 12,
and during the remainder of the month is ... abundant....
The adults, however, are so very uncommon that I have
never known them [to] represent more than five per cent of the
total number of individuals. They do not seem to be more numerous
in the earlier flights than towards the close of the month,
and I am very sure that they cannot be found in this locality before
the young begin to appear." While the present samples show an
abundance of adult <i>females</i> of this species (could Brewster have
failed to recognize these as adults?) the whereabouts of the adult
males remains a mystery.</p>

<p>(b) Another variation is displayed by the Orange-crowned Warbler
(Fig. 1, H). Here also there is an increase of adults towards
the end of migration, but this increase is marked by a growing percentage
not of females but of males. Locally this species is a late
migrant compared with most others of the Parulidae. Thus the first
sample, composed of birds taken September 25-October 1, may be
regarded as fairly early in the fall migration. Immature birds compose
84.2 per cent of this sample, there being no adult males at all.
By October 5-9 the picture has changed markedly, the sample being
composed of 44 per cent adults (82 per cent of which, in turn,
are males) and 56 per cent immatures. In view of this trend one
can not help suspecting that a still later sample would show a majority
of adults, perhaps nearly all males. This of course does not
necessarily follow; the migration of immatures could simply be
more protracted, and could have commenced earlier, than that of
adults.</p>

<p>Little imagination is required to see how enlightening it might be
could we analyze thoroughly the patterns of all migrating species.
When the detailed facts are available, it seems likely that general
trends will emerge which may be of great significance to the study
of migration in general. A final point which must eventually be
clarified is determination of the extent of variability in the pattern
of each species from year to year and locality to locality.</p>

<p>Once patterns of precedence in migration of different classes are
established, search into the life-histories of the species concerned
may help to explain the peculiarities discovered. In the present
case, for instance, we find a possible clue to the reason for the high
proportion of adult females of the Dickcissel late in migration, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
shown by our sample. Gross (1921:14-15) presented evidence that
adult female Dickcissels molt considerably later than their mates,
and we have independent evidence that individuals of this species
are at times almost flightless when molting the remiges!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Molt in Relation to Migration</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">General comment.</span>&mdash;The exact relationship between molt and
migration seems not to have been definitely established. The subject
has received cursory attention in the literature and conflicting
opinions have been expressed. Dwight (1900:126-128) believed
that molt is completed or nearly completed before migration in
nearly all passerine species that occur in New York save for certain
swallows and flycatchers. Molt has since been found to precede
migration of at least one of the flycatchers (<i>Empidonax virescens</i>)
considered by Dwight to be an exception to this rule (Mengel,
1952). In Great Britain the subject of molt in migration was considered
in some detail by Rintoul and Baxter (1914) and Ticehurst
(1916), who arrived at conclusions similar to Dwight's. These
workers also found certain swallows to be exceptions to the rule.</p>

<p>The above authors and others have shown that, at least among
passerines, some body molt is frequently found in migrating individuals
but that molt of tail feathers is much less often found and
molt of remiges almost nonexistent. Baxter and Rintoul noted only
four cases of molting wing feathers among hundreds of migrants.
Among the diverse non-passerine orders the picture seems to be
more complicated, as might be expected. We do not, however,
comprehend the reasoning which led Meinertzhagen (1930:56) to
summarize: "... on the whole it can be said that though birds
seldom migrate when flight feathers are in quill, moult in general
does not influence migration." This seems to us an obvious <i>non
sequitur</i>. Meinertzhagen (<i>loc. cit.</i>) went on to say: "Males and
females of one species are believed to moult simultaneously [see,
however, Dwight, 1900:127], and there is no doubt that in some
cases the two sexes migrate at slightly different times, and occasionally
prefer different winter quarters. Birds of the year never
moult their quills previous to their first autumn migration [Consultation
of Dwight, 1900, who gives many examples of this, would
have spared Meinertzhagen this error.], and yet they frequently
follow adults on passage and sometimes precede them. There are
no grounds for believing that adults have moulted their quills before
birds of the year are prepared to migrate [but there are, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>many cases; <i>cf.</i> Dwight, 1900:127], in the case where adults precede
the latter. Neither is there any evidence to show that adults
have not moulted their quills till after their offspring are ready for
passage, in the case where they follow their offspring. It does not,
therefore, appear that moult is an important factor."</p>

<p>Comments interpolated above show our feeling that this summary
is inadequate and misleading. To us it seems that the extreme
rarity in migration of birds with remiges in molt is strong
evidence that molt <i>does</i> influence at least the time of migration. It
is immaterial whether this molt occurs before or after migration,
although in the majority of cases it seems to take place before.
Much more needs to be known of the migration pattern and molt
of each species before generalizations can safely be made.</p>

<p>Analysis of samples of migrants can show only the presence and
nature or the absence of molt in birds actually migrating. In the
present instance shortage of time and manpower for preserving
some and processing all of the sample resulted in incomplete data
being kept on molt. We include this section to emphasize uncertainties
still prevalent and to stimulate further work.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Molt in the Topeka sample.</span>&mdash;Our limited findings coincide with
those of Rintoul and Baxter (1914). Body molt was noted in a
number of individuals and species. When present, this molt almost
invariably was in its final stages. One immature male Rose-breasted
Grosbeak (October 1) was in heavy body molt. It is perhaps
worthy of mention here that this grosbeak evidently migrates at
times in extensive molt. An adult male (RMM 1102) taken by
Mengel near Henderson, Kentucky, on September 9, 1949, was
molting plumage of body, wings, and tail, no feather of the last
being longer than one half inch. This remarkable specimen had
only five primaries on one side and four on the other fully functional.
The outermost on the left and two outermost on the right
were from the previous plumage, not yet dropped; the three innermost
of each wing were new and full-length.</p>

<p>In the present sample molt of remiges was noted in one specimen,
an adult female Indigo Bunting (October 1) with outer primaries
sheathed and with molt in progress in the body plumage. The one
(immature) Yellow-breasted Chat in the sample (October 1) had
all of its tail feathers nearly full-length but in quill, possibly as a
result of accident, and two feathers were being replaced also in the
tail of an immature Clay-colored Sparrow (October 6), which was
also in body molt and had some, juvenal feathers on the belly and
flanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Body molt near completion was further noted as follows: immature
male Yellow-throated Vireo (October 1), adult male Blue-headed
Vireo (October 1), immature female Leconte Sparrow (October
23), several Lincoln Sparrows (various dates).</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Size Differences according to Sex and Age</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Linear measurements.</span>&mdash;Taxonomists long have recognized in
many species that males differ in size from females. Less attention,
until recently, has been paid to the relative sizes of adult and immature
birds. Many taxonomists, however, seem to have had an
uneasy suspicion that immature birds are "untrustworthy" in comparison
with adults, and immatures have often been excluded from
samples when recognizable. Since, however, there are still relatively
few reliably aged specimens in collections, for the most part
only those immature birds immediately recognizable as such by
obvious plumage differences (which are often present only in
juvenal plumage) have been excluded from series. The majority
of birds in first winter plumage so closely resemble adults that the
two ages have been included in series for measurement. In most
passerines these younger birds still bear the juvenal feathers in
wing and tail and are, in size of these important parts, quite as
"untrustworthy" as birds still in juvenal body plumage. Even if a
complete postjuvenal molt occurs we still should not assume that
first winter feathers are as long as adult winter feathers without
first determining that this is so. Although aware of this problem,
systematists until recently seemingly have been more or less content
to disregard it, or forced to do so for practical reasons. Miller
(1941:179) had little choice but to hope that size differences between
adult and immature juncos were unimportant. Behle (1942:217)
wrote of Horned Larks, <i>Eremophila alpestris</i>: "... the
plumages of first-year birds and adults seem indistinguishable,
though I have never quite satisfied myself that there are no differences
in lengths of rectrices and remiges." He added, with
logic confusing to us: "Since it is a difficult problem to determine
the ages of horned larks that have passed the postjuvenal molt, this
similarity of plumages is fortunate for the systematist."</p>

<p>In recent years, some workers have analyzed size differences between
adults and immatures. Sibley (1950:115) showed that adult
Red-eyed Towhees (<i>Pipilo erythrophthalmus</i>) had notably longer
wings and tails than immatures, and the same was demonstrated in
Red Crossbills (<i>Loxia curvirostra</i>) by Tordoff (1952). In work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>with jays (<i>Aphelocoma</i>), Pitelka (1951:199) found that: "...
in comparisons of dimensions of sex and age groups within a given
sample, although magnitude of difference varies from one character
to another, most of the averages are successively smaller for first-year
males and adult and first-year females." He listed exceptions
and concluded: "Segregation [of sex and age classes] has proved
to be of extreme significance in an interpretation of individual and
geographic variation."</p>

<p>Much along these lines can be learned by examination of large
random samples such as that afforded by the Topeka accident. Although
only a few species in this sample were measured, the results
secured seem to show further the need for segregation of
age classes in taxonomic work with some species.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the variation in the lengths of wing and tail in
the Nashville Warbler. It is evident from the figure that in both
of these characters the four sex- and age-classes differ significantly.
An accurate idea of geographic variation in this species could not
be obtained without separating these classes in comparisons. Age
classes in spring and summer, long after the skull is completely
ossified, can be segregated only if differences in plumage can be
found. In the Nashville Warbler, such differences occur in fall
(see annotated list) but these probably are obliterated by the partial
prenuptial molt. These facts emphasize the importance, for
taxonomic studies, of aged specimens collected in late summer or
early fall on their breeding ground and in fresh winter plumage.
Figure 3 shows the variation in length of wing in the Lincoln Sparrow
in which age seems to be of much less importance than in the
Nashville Warbler. Males and females of the Lincoln Sparrow
differ significantly in wing-length, but adults and immatures are
of nearly the same size. It would seemingly not be necessary to
separate age classes in studies of geographic variation in the Lincoln
Sparrow. Size data for some other species are given in the
annotated list.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Weights.</span>&mdash;Little seems to have been done to determine the correlation
of weights with sex- and age-classes. Weight may be the
best single index of over-all size and is especially useful to students
of the physiology of migration. Weight, however, is subject to the
considerable variable imposed by fat condition. In large and comparable
series, this variable is probably removed insofar as comparability
of means is concerned, but the high variability of weight
in most cases naturally results in more overlap (less separability)
between populations with means close together than is found with
most linear measurements.</p>

<p>Figures 4-6 show variation in weight in the samples of Nashville
Warbler, Mourning Warbler, Yellow-throat, Dickcissel, and Lincoln
Sparrow. Each figure is essentially self-explanatory. It will
be seen that in the Nashville Warbler and Lincoln Sparrow, weight
is roughly proportional to wing-length (shown in figs. 2 and 3),
giving about equally good separation of sex- and age-classes in the
latter and poorer separation in the former. Data for these and
other species indicate a generally greater weight of males than of
females, but less difference according to age. In some other species,
for example the Yellow-throat, immatures seem to be a little heavier
on the average than adults. It is unfortunate that wing-lengths are
not at present available for these.</p>

<p>These comments on weight suggest an additional factor which
may play a part in rate of migration and which some day may be
profitably studied. Suppose that in some species adults and immatures
are nearly the same in weight but that immatures have
shorter wings. In such a species the immatures are relatively
shorter-winged for their weight than adults. In aerodynamic terms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a><br /><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a><br /><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>they would have a higher "wing-loading." (Wing-loading is the
result obtained by dividing area of effective wing by total weight;
it is here assumed that in a single species wing area is directly proportional
to wing length.) This being the case, immatures with
higher "wing-loading" would require more energy (derived from
fat) to fly the same distance as adults, or with the same amount of
fat they would fly a shorter distance. Thus they might tend to be
outstripped in migration by adults starting at the same time. The
reverse, of course, would also be theoretically true, if adults possessed
a higher wing-loading than immatures. Physical factors
such as these rather than the differential "virility" postulated by
Meinertzhagen (1930:56) might account for the arrival of certain
classes of some species on the wintering grounds in advance of
others. There are, of course, many other factors which must be
taken into account before the effect, if any, of the wing-loading
factor can be evaluated. Data for illuminating calculations will
become available, however, with the accumulation of abundant information
on weights, measurements, and migration patterns.</p>

<h2>Computations of Longevity and Survival</h2>


<p>Tanner (ms., and letter, April 21, 1955) recently devoted considerable
ingenuity to computing by actuarial methods the longevity
of the Oven-bird, using the adult-immature ratio in samples killed
at a ceilometer at Knoxville, Tennessee. Tanner's computations
were based on the simple assumption that</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="formula">
<tr><td rowspan="2">S (survival rate) =</td>
    <td>Number of adults in population (or sample)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="bor_top">Total size of population (or sample).</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Further application of such techniques may prove desirable and
rewarding. It would seem at present, however, to be a risky procedure,
as it has been abundantly shown (see above) that adults
and immatures often do not migrate at the same times and rates,
and the ratios of adults to immatures in samples of migrants are
likely to be far from representative of the true proportions in the
populations concerned. It should be added that Tanner is perfectly
aware of this objection.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Processing of Samples</h2>


<p>Thorough processing of large samples of birds killed accidentally
is time-consuming. We were fortunate in having considerable assistance;
even so, all desirable data could not be obtained from the
1090 birds of the present sample. As aids to others conducting
studies of this kind we should mention a few points which may be
of assistance.</p>

<p>Birds should be picked up as soon as possible after death, certainly
by the end of the day after the accident and preferably much
sooner. They should be weighed as soon as possible after collection
(weights decrease rapidly, even under refrigeration), and the
weights (in grams, to one tenth of a gram) written on tags attached
to a leg of each specimen. The sample should then be
sorted by species or groups of species of approximately equal size
(to avoid crushing of smaller birds by larger ones), placed in boxes,
paper bags, or better, air-tight containers clearly marked with date,
locality, and other necessary particulars, and relegated to a deep-freeze
compartment. For all but the smallest samples, such freezing
units are indispensable to complete study. Once frozen, the birds
may be selected for study at leisure, but time is still important, as,
even when frozen, gonads may eventually deteriorate, and birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
eventually become desiccated which is a disadvantage if skins are
to be made.</p>

<p>In the cases of large kills, or limited manpower, or both, it may
be impossible to process all birds, however desirable this might be.
If possible, however, all should be collected, identified, the numbers
and species recorded, and rarities saved. Further, partial analysis,
or more properly, complete analysis of a partial sample, can be
made. Analyses which for any reason require randomness of
sample pose a special problem. We think that in very large kills
the best way to solve this problem is probably to make one or more
transects across the area where dead birds are found. These
transects should cross both the areas of greatest and least density
(to allow for fast and slow flying species). Their width may be
adjusted to give the desired number of birds, that is, the number
that can be adequately processed. Another alternative would be
to decide to study certain abundant species and pick up all of these.
There are other possibilities, but in any event the method of
sampling should be thoroughly described wherever all birds have
not been processed.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>


<p>The foregoing paper discusses accidents in which large numbers
of night-migrating birds are killed. A brief historical review of
ornithological interest in such occurrences is given, and the types
of data provided by the accidents are listed and discussed. In particular,
recent accidents occurring in early October, 1954, through
much of eastern United States are cited, and detailed analysis is
presented of a sample of 1090 birds killed one mile west of Topeka,
Shawnee County, Kansas, between September 25 and October 23,
1954.</p>

<p>At Topeka during the period mentioned, 1090 birds representing
61 species were collected and were processed at the University of
Kansas. For all specimens, weight, sex, age, and fat condition were
recorded, and certain species were measured as well. Some notes
on molt were taken. A total of 193 birds was preserved as study
skins, and 49 as skeletons. Comments on weight, size, sex, age,
subspecific identity, and status in Kansas are presented in an annotated
list.</p>

<p>Randomness of this and other similar samples is discussed. A
theoretical computation is given for several nights of the numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
of migrants passing through a plane one mile in width, from 450
to 950 feet above ground level, and oriented to face the arriving
migrants. The computed totals give some idea of the tremendous
volume of nocturnal migration under some conditions. Potentialities
of further study of such events are discussed and a comparison
is made with lunar observations.</p>

<p>Differential migration of sex- and age-groups as shown by the
larger samples taken at Topeka (Catbird, Red-eyed Vireo, Nashville
Warbler, Yellow-throat, Mourning Warbler, Dickcissel, Lincoln
Sparrow) is discussed and the history of theories on this subject
reviewed. It is shown that age and sex must both be taken
into account in studies of differential migration. Several patterns
of migration are displayed by the species analyzed, adults migrating
earlier than immatures in some instances, young earlier than adults
in others, but all seemingly being complicated to varying degrees
by differential migration of sexes within age groups. It is suggested
that explanations of these patterns may be sought in the
life histories of the species involved.</p>

<p>Molt in relation to migration is discussed briefly, and it is held
that there is an important relationship between molt and time of
migration. Specimens noted to be in molt are listed.</p>

<p>Size differences, in wing length, tail length, and weight are discussed
in relation to sex and age, and variation in one or more of
these characters is analyzed as found in the Topeka samples of
Nashville Warbler, Mourning Warbler, Yellow-throat, Dickcissel,
and Lincoln Sparrow. It seems that in some instances significant
size differences prevail between adults and immatures and that
these age classes should be separated in taxonomic work with species
where differences in size are known to exist. When the facts
are not known they should be determined, and the large samples
collected in accidents to nocturnal migrants present excellent opportunities
for ascertaining the facts.</p>

<p>Other uses of material obtained in large migration accidents are
discussed, such as computations of longevity and the problems of
processing large, accidentally-killed samples. Care should be taken
to select samples as nearly random as possible when all birds cannot
be processed.</p>

<p>Repeated and thorough analysis of accidental kills should provide
a mass of valuable data bearing on many questions and problems
which have thus far been little studied.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
